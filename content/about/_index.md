### Current

 I am currently working as a **product developer and data analyst** for the German Socialdemocratic Party (**SPD**). I am the product owner of a large analytics database that integrates information from various sources (electoral results, membership data, email marketing, social media, shop,...). I translate the demands for reportings and analyses from internal stakeholders into stories implemented by external service providers. Moreover, I create reportings and conduct in-depth analyses using Tableau and R. 

This position is a replacement for a parental leave and will end in August. I will be looking for a job from September onwards. 

### Past employment

From 2013 to 2018 I worked as a **research fellow** at the [WZB Berlin social science center](https://www.wzb.eu) in [the Manifesto project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu). A long-standing research project that collects, digitizes and analyzes **electoral programs** from political parties from all over the world. In 2018, next to this job, I worked as a freelance analyst for the SPD which helped to get the job above.

From 2011 to 2013 I received a scholarship from the Berlin Graduate School of Social Sciences at Humboldt University. In 2013, I abandoned the scholarship in favor of the position mentioned above.

### Education

I am a trained political scientist. I finished my **PhD in 2017 in political science at Humdoldt-University Berlin**. I worked on the question whether mass media mediate the messages covered in parties' electoral programs. The dissertation is published [open-access](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/19591). Before my PhD, I graduated in political science (Master of Arts) in 2011 at Free University Berlin. I did my Bachelor's degree in Political Science (major) and French (minor). In between my BA and MA, I studied at the Institut d'Etudes Politique (Science Po) Lille in France.
